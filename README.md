A Lidar based on Roborock LDS(Laser Distance Sensor) for STEM

Since Roborock launched it's first robot vacuum there were many colledge students and robot fans from all world asking for more information about the LDS, and some engineers bought our robot vacuum and then disassembled it just for the LDS because even the price of the whole robot is much cheaper than the other LiDARs.

In fact the original LDS is not very friendly for fans becasue of the limited IO and you have to make a PWM singal to control the DC motor's speed by yourself. So we are going to develop a STEM friendly version for a very low price or even maybe free for the students and research purpose.

So, be free to tell us what do you think about that and what feature do you expect for the LDS?
